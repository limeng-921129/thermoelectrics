## Heat Transport

### Thermal Conductivity
Total thermal conductivity ( $\]rm \kappa\_{tot}$ ) is comprised of:
$$\kappa\_{tot}=\kappa\_e+\kappa\_l+\kappa\_{bip}$$
where $\kappa\_e$ is electronic tensor component (or electronic thermal conductivity), $\kappa\_l$ is lattice tensor component (or lattice thermal conductivity), and $\kappa\_{bip}$ is bipolar thermal conductivity.

#### Lattice Thermal Conductivity


##### Specific Heat Capacity
The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a material is known as the heat capacity â€” $C_V$ at constant volume or $C_P$ at constant pressure. When this term is expressed as the amount of heat energy per unit mass of material needed to raise its temperature by 1 K, it is referred to as specific heat capacity.
