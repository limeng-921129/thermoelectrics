## Heat Transport

### Thermal Conductivity
The formulation of total thermal conductivity $\kappa\_{\rm {tot}}$ is:
$$\kappa\_{\rm {tot}}=\kappa\_{\rm e}+\kappa\_{\rm l}+\kappa\_{\rm {bip}}$$
where $\kappa\_{\rm e}$ is electronic tensor component (or electronic thermal conductivity), $\kappa\_{\rm l}$ is lattice tensor component (or lattice thermal conductivity), and $\kappa\_{\rm {bip}}$ is bipolar thermal conductivity.

#### Electronic Thermal Conductivity


#### Lattice Thermal Conductivity
The formulation of lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa\_{\rm l}$ is:
&&\kappa\_{\rm l}=&&

##### Specific Heat Capacity
The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a material is known as the heat capacity â€” $C_{\rm V}$ at constant volume or $C_{ \rm P}$ at constant pressure. When this term is expressed as the amount of heat energy per unit mass of material needed to raise its temperature by 1 K, it is referred to as specific heat capacity.
