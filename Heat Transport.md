## Heat Transport

### Thermal Conductivity
The formulation of total thermal conductivity ( $\kappa\_{\rm {tot}}$ ) is:
$$\kappa\_{\rm {tot}}=\kappa\_{\rm e}+\kappa\_{\rm l}+\kappa\_{\rm {bip}}$$
where $\kappa\_{\rm e}$ is electronic tensor component (or electronic thermal conductivity), $\kappa\_{\rm l}$ is lattice tensor component (or lattice thermal conductivity), and $\kappa\_{\rm {bip}}$ is bipolar thermal conductivity.

#### Electronic Thermal Conductivity


#### Lattice Thermal Conductivity
The formulation of lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa\_{\rm l}$ is:
$$\kappa\_{\rm l}=\frac {1}{3} \cdot C_{\rm V} \cdot v \cdot l$$
where $v$ is phonon group velocity, and $l$ is phonon mean free path ( MFP ).

##### Specific Heat Capacity
The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a material is known as the heat capacity—$C_{\rm V}$ at constant volume or $C_{ \rm P}$ at constant pressure. When this term is expressed as the amount of heat energy per unit mass of material needed to raise its temperature by 1 K, it is referred to as specific heat capacity.
Normal and Umklapp scattering mechanisms are both responsible for heat propagation in solids. Through Normal scattering, momentum is conserved; through Umklapp scattering, momentum is not conserved. At low temperatures, Normal scattering is dominant due to a lower phonon population and Umklapp scattering has just a minor contribution. When the temperature is high enough, Umklapp scattering can be considerable due to increased phonon–phonon scattering.
